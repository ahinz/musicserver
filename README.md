# Sound Server via Clojure

A Clojure app designed to allow coworkers to share music.

## Usage

Listen to music with coworkers and friends! On the computer with
speakers start the server:

```
$ lein run server
```

To add clients to the server have each client run something like:

```
$ lein run client --port 10100 --file example.txt --server http://localhost:3131
```

The client will ping the server and start playing music. Any number of
clients can connect to the music server. As songs complete each server
is queried in a round-robin fashion for the next song to play.

## TODO

- Dropping clients will probably cause a crash... probably should drop
  them from the list

- Using mplayer to play the music to avoid downloading a ton of java
  junk. Probably should download java junk to avoid the dependency
